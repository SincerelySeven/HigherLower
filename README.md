Higher/Lower Game Project created as part of a 100 Days of Code Python course.
The game is a simple game where the player must guess which of two subjects has a higher follower count, based on data provided in the course.

NOTE: It is worth noting that this is a very simple project completed in around 30 minutes, and is not as refined or impressive as many of my other projects.
