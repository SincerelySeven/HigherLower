Higher/Lower Game Project created as part of a 100 Days of Code Python course.

NOTE: These files were added via upload and not tested after upload due to issues uploading to GitHub directly.
The project works in the environment it was created in, but I uploaded it here just to have a sample of my work in Python.

It is also worth noting that this is a very simple project completed in around 30 minutes, and is not as refined or impressive as many of my other projects.

The game is a simple game where the player must guess which of two subjects has a higher follower count, based on data provided in the course.
